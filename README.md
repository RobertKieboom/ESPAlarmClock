# ESPAlarmClock
This is our first Home "Thing", an alarm clock.
The project is started because Tim wants an alarm that works during weektime, but automatically switches of in the weekend.

It is work in progress, but the following features will be implemented:
- Wifi enabled time, automatic, daylight saving
- MQTT communication with the cloud
- Alarm times for every day; change from the cloud
- Manual alarm time override for the next day
- Wake up light (sun emulation)
- Desk lamp for specific period
- RTC, remembering time even if there is no WIFI
- USB powered
- MP3 player/sounds for alarm
- Temperature, humidity, pressure & ambient light sensors
- Sending sensor values to the cloud
- Light sensing for setting the brightness of the display
- USB output to charge a phone/tablet

Happy making!
